// Please note that C++ does not have built-in support for some mathematical functions like sqrt, log, exp, abs, pow, fmod, and hypot. You would need to include the <cmath> library to use these functions from my code.

// Also, C++ does not have built-in support for complex numbers or matrix operations. You would need to use a library that supports these features, such as the Eigen library.

// Finally, please note that this C++ code only includes the mathematical functions from my Python code. The Discord bot functionality cannot be directly translated to C++ as these libraries do not have direct equivalents in C++. You would need to use different libraries or frameworks in C++ to achieve similar functionality. For example, you might use discord.cpp for the Discord bot. Please consult the respective libraryâ€™s documentation for more details on how to use them.
